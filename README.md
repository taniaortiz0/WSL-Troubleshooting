# WSL-Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting WSL to conduct DevOps projects

Found out that I am going to be fully working on WSL command line in order to make this project (Netbox Metric Exporter) to run smoothly so, Pycharm will just have the logic or the network automation setup.

Issue started with the `/mnt/c/...`:

I tried to add UV as the Interpreter, but it gives an Invalid statement and once I did my Google searching, I have to do my work mainly on the WSL command line.

Lists of Fixes I have to make:

- Had to remove a project made through PyCharm and then deleting that one in GitLab
- Switched my workspace to WSL command line
- To be continued... (Got to fix this grammer and other things..)
